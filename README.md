## TESTING GUIDE

Assuming the backend is running, my login is:
Username: bajohnson Password: password

Not very secure, but the purpose of the application is to be a demonstration. 

To create an account, press the orange text at the bottom of the login screen. You may have to reload the application. Once fully filled out with a valid email and matching passwords, you'll be taken back to the login screen. Feel free to peruse the terms and conditions, I don't think there's anything funny if you scroll down.

Once logged in, you'll see the navigation menu on the left side, and you can edit your profile as you see fit, make some posts, look at some comments and feel free to send me a message if you find any interesting bugs!
